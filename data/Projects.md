# Project datasets

## Ornish

The dataset comes from the publication of the MEvA-X tool for biomarker discovery. It contains microarry gene expression, with information of Age, Gender, COPD, Diabetes, and WeightLoss, making 13524 features on 89 samples. The WeightLoss information was transformed into a binary variable: Responders for those with a weight loss higher than 10%, and Non_responders otherwise. The objective is to investigate the relationship between weight loss and gene expression profiles.

## OPERA

This dataset is also obtained from the abovementioned publication of the MEvA-X tool. It consists of 631 patients with 50 survey questions. The objective is to investigate the effect of replacing opioid therapies with topical analgesics on patients with chronic pain and record the changes in multiple aspects of their life such as pain and medicine reduction, interference with everyday activities, and reduction of complaints.

## Xsurv

The data come from the publication of the R package Xsurv for prognostic biomarker discovery with high-dimensional features and survival outcomes. It contains 320 patients with 3 clinical covariates (sex, age, and metastatic melanoma stage) and 200 filtered methylation CpG sites. The objective is to identify CpG sites with prognostic values.
